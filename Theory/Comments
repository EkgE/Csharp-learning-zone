             * - comment portions of code that are difficult to understand
             * - keep the comments simple and direct
             * - comments should be correct and up-to-date
             * - you can comment out lines of code by coding an apostrophe before them
             * - stay with consistent style of commenting
             * - avoid obvious comments
             * - break long comments into paragraphs
             * - comment code while writing it
             * - write comments as if they were for you
